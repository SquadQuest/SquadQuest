### Notes for Implementer

This scraper should be implemented following the patterns and best practices documented in [Event Scraper Development Guide](../supabase/functions/scrape-event/README.md).

Key implementation steps:

1. Check for structured data (JSON-LD) first
2. Look for official API/SDK options
3. Consider third-party libraries
4. Fall back to client-side extraction if needed

Remember to:

- Add example URLs in comments
- Document any rate limits
- Handle timezone conversion
- Add the scraper to sources/index.ts in appropriate order
