/**
 * How to invoke this CLI, as a runnable command prefix. The bundle ships inside
 * a skill and is **not on `PATH`**, so emitted examples (home view, ambient hook
 * output, help[] hints, error suggestions) must use the resolved path — otherwise
 * an agent that reads a bare `appstore` in a hint assumes it's on PATH and the call
 * fails.
 *
 * Prefers the sibling shim (`…/scripts/appstore`) when it's executable, since that
 * matches how SKILL.md documents invocation; falls back to `node <bundle>` which
 * always works. Home dir is collapsed to `~`.
 *
 * (Note: SKILL.md's own examples are hardcoded to the relative `scripts/appstore`
 * form — this helper is only for output the CLI emits at runtime.)
