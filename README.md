## What is SquadQuest?

SquadQuest aims to be the painless way to rally your friends to do stuff together IRL.

SquadQuest *is not* a social network. Social networks help you build shallow connections with people you don't really know. You will not see people on SquadQuest that you don't already know and they won't see you. SquadQuest is designed to help you spend more time out in the real world with people you know.

SquadQuest *is not* a startup. The need to monetize your data or engagement to return investment to VCs is why nothing like SquadQuest exists already. SquadQuest couldn't do it's job as well as it possibly could if those concerns had to take precedence. We're building SquadQuest because we want it to exist and we want it to be as useful as possible. SquadQuest is built by its users, *for* its users. At some point we will likely accept donations to support operating costs, but for now the focus is on keeping operating costs as low as possible.

*Who is Jarvus Innovations?* Jarvus is the open-source civic technology consultancy that SquadQuest's original author helps run. SquadQuest is published under Jarvus' developer accounts in the Google and Apple app stores because it's a pain to set those up without a business entity and Jarvus already had them. Eventually SquadQuest will be transfered to its own developer accounts or those of a nonprofit custodian.

## Roadmap

Some major milestones currently envisioned include:

### Upcoming

- **SMS Integration**: Invite friends more easily by sending friend requests or event invitations to people who aren't on SquadQuest yet through SMS
- **Rally Point Search**: Search for rally points by name and pick from results instead of only being able to drag a pin around
- **Interest-based Push Notifications**: Get configurable automatic push notification alerts when friends or public organizers post events matching your interests
- **Calendar Integration**: See the events you're going to right in the mobile calendar you already use
- **Polling**: Ping friends about potential event to find out what times might work for everyone
- **Smart Event Suggestions**: Tell SquadQuest what you want to do more of and it'll keep an eye out for times that you and friends with the same interest have room on your calendar

### Complete

- **Live Friends Map**: See where friends on their way to or at the same event live on a map with trails that show you which way and how fast they're going
- **Event Map Pin**: Attach a pinned location on a map to an event
- **Cancel Events**: Set an event you created to cancelled and alert everyone who RSVPed
- **Editing Events**: Make changes to events you already posted
- **Topic Subscription**: Maintain a list of topics you're interested in seeing and getting alerted about new events under
- **Native Android and iOS app**: Install SquadQuest from app stores for the smoothest possible experience (beta links available above)
- **Live Map**: See a live map under each event showing the event's pinned location and live markers for every attendee who has switched their RSVP to OMW
- **Push Notifications**: Get instant notifications when you're outside the app when you receive a friend request, an event invitation, or someone RSVPs to an event you posted
- **Realtime Updates**: Screens update in real time when anything gets changed by someone else

- **RSVPs**: Set and update your RSVP status to events as no, maybe, yes, or OMW
- **Events**: Post events that can be visible publically, only to your friends, or only to people you directly invite.
- **Buddy List**: Build a list of friends you connect with by their phone number. Friend connections have to be accepted on the other end and then are mutual
